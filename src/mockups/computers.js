        description: "For the last year, the Dell XPS 13 has been our favorite notebook, because it combined a slim, light and attractive design with excellent battery life at a good price. For the newest version, Dell tweaked that winning combination by adding a 6th-generation Intel Skylake processor, Thunderbolt 3 port and a higher-capacity battery. The updated XPS 13 is faster than ever and, despite a step backward in battery life, lasts nearly 12 hours on a charge. This remains one of the best ultraportable laptops on the market.",
